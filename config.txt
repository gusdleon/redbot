## Basic configuration

# Output language (not working yet; see #169).

# Output character set. No real reason to change from UTF-8.
charset = utf-8


## Test configuration

# How many seconds to allow a check to run for.
max_runtime = 60

# Limit on how many links to check in a page when descending
max_links = 100


## Web server configuration

# Hostname to listen on. Comment out to listen on all interfaces.
host = localhost

# Port to listen on.

#  - .html': shown only on start page, after input block
#  - '.js': javascript block (with script tag surrounding), included on every page view.

# URI root for static assets (absolute or relative, but no trailing '/').

# Whether to make links in the HTML content view clickable (starting new tests). This is
# expensive, and may cause redbot_daemon to be unresponsive.

## Saved Tests

# Where to keep files when users `save` them. Note that files will be automatically
# deleted from this directory, so it needs to be only used for REDbot.
# Comment out to disable saving.
